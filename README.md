# live-flight-map

Created as part of a Space Apps weekend at the Met Office, for the [clouds or contrails challenge](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/aero/clouds-or-contrails/projects)

This page uses data from FlightAware and plots the tracks or aircraft currently passing overhead, colouring the track based on their likelihood of producing a contrail.
a live demo is available [here](http://spaceapps-exeter-cloud-or-contrails.github.io/live-flight-map/)
